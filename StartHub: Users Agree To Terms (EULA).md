Terms of Use (EULA) - StartHub Application
----------------

### Effective Date: 25/07/2023

Welcome to StartHub! Before using our application, please read and accept the following Terms of Use ("EULA"). By creating an account or using our application, you agree to be bound by these terms, as well as our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use StartHub.

### Purpose of StartHub
StartHub is a professional networking application that facilitates connections between users through a matching mechanism. Users can create an account, provide information they wish to share (such as name, description, company, and preferences), and access a matching feature where various profiles are displayed. Users can choose to match or not with other profiles. If a match occurs, a private conversation will be initiated between the two users. The other user will receive an alert in the conversation, enabling them to accept or reject the match. Upon mutual acceptance, both users will be added to each other's match lists. If a user rejects the match, the conversation will be deleted, and the two users will not appear in each other's match lists. Additionally, StartHub offers a "block user" option, allowing users to prevent specific individuals from appearing in their application. Users also have the ability to report other users, flagging them for review by our development team, who will respond within 24 hours.

### User-Generated Content
StartHub includes user-generated content. To ensure a safe and positive environment, we enforce specific measures to moderate content and prevent abusive behavior. By accepting these terms, users agree to the following:

Users must agree to these terms, acknowledging that objectionable content or abusive behavior will not be tolerated.
StartHub employs a content filtering mechanism to identify and remove objectionable content.
Users can report objectionable content, enabling StartHub to take necessary actions promptly.
Users can block abusive users, preventing further interactions with them.
StartHub commits to act on reports of objectionable content within 24 hours, promptly removing the content and ejecting the user responsible.

### No Tolerance Policy
StartHub maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards objectionable content, abusive users, and any violation of our terms. Users engaging in such behavior risk termination of their account and access to StartHub.

### Reporting and Feedback
We value user feedback and take reported incidents seriously. If you encounter objectionable content or abusive behavior, please use the reporting mechanism to notify us. StartHub's development team will review each report and take appropriate actions.

### Changes to EULA
StartHub may update or modify these terms from time to time. Users will be notified of any changes through the application or via email. Continued use of StartHub after the changes indicate acceptance of the updated EULA.
